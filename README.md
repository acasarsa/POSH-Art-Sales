- should have a count of how many objects on user (galleries) index
- Artwork index should said "Gallery:" not "Owned by" ? (maybe?)
- total likes on show pages-user
- how much art is worth- user page 
- add validations for buying 
- sort_by options on user gallery 
- add like button to artwork index page
